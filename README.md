# 🛡️ Role Playing Game

A simple, interactive **RPG-style game** built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, created as part of the [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification.  
This exercise focuses on applying JavaScript logic to build interactive gameplay elements, while reinforcing DOM manipulation, conditionals, events, and data structures.
